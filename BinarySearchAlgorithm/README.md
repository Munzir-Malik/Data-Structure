# Binary Search Algorithm

The Binary Search Algorithm is an efficient searching technique that works on the principle of **divide and conquer**. It requires the input array to be sorted and repeatedly divides until find the the *target* number.

## Important points
- **Efficiency**: The algorithm's best-case scenario is when the target element is located at the middle of the array.
- **Divide and Conquer**: By halving the search space with each iteration.

## Challenges
While working with this algorithm, I found it a liitle bit challenging to understand how the search range is adjusted after each iteration. One key lesson was ensuring that the array is always sorted before applying the algorithm, which is crucial for its proper functioning.
