## Linear Search Algorithm
I understood that this algorithm works by checking all the elements in the array until finding the target number. There are three cases to evaluate your algorithm's **efficiency** in this situation.

### The Cases Are:
---
1. **Best case**: If the *target* is in the first index.
2. **Average case**: If the *target* is in one of the middle indices.
3. **Worst case**: If the *target* is in the last index.
